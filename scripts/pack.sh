# Re-sign, because the signature `swift build` leaves is not enough for TCC.
#
# The linker adds its own ad-hoc signature, flagged `linker-signed`. macOS treats that
# as "signed by nobody": TCC will not register the binary as a subject, so a permission
# request never reaches it and no dialog is ever shown. The symptom is silent — the
# request simply returns with the status still `notDetermined`.
#
# Do not try to confirm that from `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC"'`.
# That subsystem returns nothing on a normal machine whatever happens, so an empty log
# is not evidence of anything; the flags below are.
#
# Verified on macOS 26.5: `codesign --force --sign -` turns flags=0x20002
# (adhoc,linker-signed) into flags=0x2 (adhoc), and the embedded Info.plist survives.
#
# Ad-hoc is still not enough to make a grant durable — it produces no designated
# requirement, so TCC falls back to the cdhash and every rebuild re-prompts. Set
# MCPB_SIGN_IDENTITY to a real signing identity to fix that; see the README.
